# Process Manager

This OS project gives the user an overview of the processes being executed in an UNIX system.

The main objective of this project is:                                                                                              
1.to identify the system and user processes.                                                                                                                          
2.to provide CPU, memory, and I/O utilization for each process                                                                          
3.to tag a process as a CPU bound or I/O bound.                                           

This process manager helps us to segregate the processes running in a system as user and system processes and gives detailed information of each process.                 
It also provides the TOTAL CPU Utilisation, TOTAL Memory Utilisation,TOTAL I/O Utilisation for the all user and system processes.

For a Sample UNIX System:                                                                                         
The code works as shown below:
